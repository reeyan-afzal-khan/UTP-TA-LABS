"""Graph-search algorithms shared by Labs 1-3: BFS, DFS, UCS, GBFS and A*.

A graph is a dictionary ``{state: [(neighbour, cost), ...]}``. Every algorithm
returns the same ``SearchResult`` so that results can be compared in one table.
``expanded`` counts the states whose neighbours were generated; the goal state
itself is not expanded, so a start that equals the goal expands nothing.
